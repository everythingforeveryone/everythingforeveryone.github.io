## Rules

> The individual carries his social power, as well as his bond with society, in his pocket. – Karl Marx, _Grundrisse_

> Money has only one face, that of the boss. – Antonio Negri, _Marx Beyond Marx_

Money rules our lives. Whether or not we have it, how much money we carry in our pocket or in our bank account, determines our access to social wealth and our command over the time and labour of others. Without money we might end up sleeping on the street. Without money we won't eat. To obtain money – and thus access to social wealth – we must sell our ability to work, our time. We must submit to the command of others, the boss – who, in exchange, pays us a money-wage. The level of our wage – 'high' or 'low', or perhaps like the 'housewife' our work is unwaged – is a measure of how much our time is worth, of its value. Money measures the value not only of our time, but of all other commodities: not of all social wealth, but of much of it. At the same time, in the world of 'business', success is measured only by the accumulation of money, the addition of ever more zeroes in an accounting ledger: 'Accumulate! Accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets.' All that counts to the capitalist is that which can be counted in money. All other values are valueless, discounted as 'externalities'. Thus money rules in two (related) senses: first, it commands; and second, it measures.

## Cracks

But money's rule is not absolute. Everywhere we find cracks, interstices in which money does not command. Despite everything – after 500 years of capitalist ascendency and 40 years of neoliberal capitalism's 'financialisation' – we still care for one another, we can still act out of love, friendship, loyalty or solidarity – or perhaps out of hate, rage or resentment. Not everything is paid for!

Money and its rule are contested more directly too. The bread riots of the 18th century in which the 'English crowd' defended its 'moral economy'. The '_autoriducionze_' [self-reduction] of rent, energy and transport prices of Italian proletarians in the period of Autonomia Operaia in the 1970s. The 'IMF riots' that occurred across Africa and Latin America in the 1980s. The looting – very often targeted against those who prey most harshly on the community – took place during riots in English cities in the mid-1980s and then in 2011. These are just four examples of common people refusing money's command.

> I take a few steps towards the middle of the street and study the massive, anonymous construction, and then look around in confusion. Conflicting emotions pile up within me, anger, astonishment, even irony. I stop and let it all out: "Why has no one ever talked to me about banks before?" – Luther Blisset, _Q_

Given, money's centrality to capitalist command, capital and its state rigorously police the creation of money. The production of currency – notes and coins – is tightly controlled by central banks (the Bank of England, for instance). At the same time, the state permits 'commercial' and 'investment' banks to grant credit to their clients, in the process creating more money. (This arrangement is known as 'fractional reserve banking' since only a fraction of the money created by commercial banks – that is, only a fraction of the money in existence – is 'backed' by currency.)
Again though, capital's control is not complete. Time and time again, entrepreneurial individuals have attempted to simulate the currency of the state. In early 18th-century England, Isaac Newton, as 'Master of the Mint', had the job of hunting down 'coin-clippers', people who shaved a millimetre or two off the edge of silver coins and then melted down the shavings to produce new coins. (Newton introduced the practice of milling or 'reeding' coins, adding ridges to their edges, to make it obvious if a coin had been clipped.) Debasing the currency in this way was a capital offence: convicted coiners were hanged, drawn and quartered. Coin-clipping was also an offence against capital. The severity of the punishment is evidence not only of the state's cruelty, but also of the fragility of its rule and that of money. In certain parts of England, such as the Calder Valley on the border of Yorkshire and Lancashire, the practice of coining was both widespread and widely accepted within the community. This history is captured in [Benjamin Myers's novel](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-gallows-pole-9781526611154/) about the Cragg Vale Coiners and their leader 'King David' Hartley and is commemorated in events such as the [Coiners fell race](https://www.cvfr.co.uk/races/coiners/).

> I toss the coin in the air and catch it as it comes down. The writing is still clearly visible: ONE GOD, ONE FAITH, ONE BAPTISM. The relic of another defeat. A rare piece, almost unique, forged by the Münster mint. – Luther Blisset, _Q_

Perhaps less confrontationally, commoners have over and over again created other representations of their relations of mutual dependency: tokens, chits and other types of IOU. (See David Graeber's [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://libcom.org/files/__Debt__The_First_5_000_Years.pdf).) The modern incarnation of these practices goes by the name of 'alternative' or 'complementary currencies' – the Totnes pound [https://www.totnespound.org/], for example. These currencies exist in a legal and political grey area. Where they have become recognised by the authorities – perhaps there is an accepted 'exchange rate' between the local currency and the state's own notes and coins; perhaps you can pay taxes in the currency – such currencies may end up complementing capitalist money and its rule, they simply become experiments in unorthodox monetary policy.

Sometimes money-like tokens might point to worlds beyond the rule of money. Rejecting both the authority of the Pope and the clericalism of Luther – and the established order that both the Roman Church and Lutherism sustained – the cry of the Anabaptist rebels of 16th-century Europe was '[Omnia sunt communia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZt_QcylurI)' – all things in common, or [Everything for Everyone](https://everythingforeveryone.org.uk/why/)! When they took over the city of Münster in 1534–35 – a short-lived and ill-fated experiment – they struck a coin that captured their faith: 'One god, one faith, one baptism'. In late 18th-century England, Thomas Spence struck numerous 'freedom coins'. [link to file] According to historian Peter Linebaugh these 'functioned as money rather than medals' and Spence used them 'as propaganda for his plan to abolish private property in land. His policy was to diffuse agitation by song, pamphlet, graffiti, newspaper and coins!'

## A freedom coin

We have struck our own freedom coin. A two-sided token, on one side is written [A COMMON TREASURY FOR ALL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCXnol8NGbg) (or these versions by [Chumbawamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEv3LpXNX8U) and [Billy Bragg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWRpl2S9iwk)) on the other, OMNIA SUNT COMMUNIA or EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE.

Making the Earth a common treasury for all was the explicit project of Gerard Winstanley and the Diggers (or True Levellers), one of the many political and religious groups that sprang up in England in the revolutionary times of 1640–1660. In April 1649, Winstanley and a 'ragged band of Diggers' established a colony on St George's Hill (in present-day Surrey – it's now site of a 964-acre private estate). According to historian Christopher Hill, 'St George's Hill may have been only the visible tip of the iceberg of True Levellerism' – other colonies appeared at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, Cox Hall in Kent, Iver in Buckinghamshire, Barnet, Hertfordshire, Enfield in Middlesex, Dunstable in Bedfordshire, Bosworth in Leicestershire and also at unknown places in Gloucestershire and Nottinghamshire. The Diggers wanted to abolish private property; they believed all wealth should be held, worked and produced in common. 

OMNIA SUNT COMMUNIA or EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE is a maximalist slogan. (It's not a demand.) It flows from the insight that we have made everything – social relations above all – ourselves. And, if we made everything ourselves, then we can re-make it differently. Inequality isn’t natural. Injustice isn’t natural. The market isn’t natural. These are all things we can make and un-make. And, if we made everything ourselves, then it’s all ours. Everything for everyone! As someone put it succinctly on Twitter:

> Look out the goddamned windows people. Everything you see belongs to us. We ain’t building no alternative nothing. THIS SHIT IS OURS!

'Everything for Everyone' is open-ended, it's expansive. It has no boundaries. What do we want? Everything! Who are we? Everyone! No-one – and nothing – is excluded. It clarifies things not by drawing lines on a battlefield but by re-framing the question that’s implicit in those battles: what sort of world do we want to live in? In this respect, it’s a slogan that seeks to fulfil the promise of The Internationale and '[unite the human race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz9x33atx44)'.

We want to produce – and distribute – as many of these tokens as we can – and we want it to be a collective project. Gigs, festivals, galas and fetes, exhibitions, conferences and gatherings: these are all ideal places to distribute. Instead of – or as well as – passing round a bucket or hat and asking for donations, you pass round a bucket- or a hatful of tokens and invite people to take one.

The deal is as follows. We plan to have the tokens struck on DATE. We have created a Kickstarter campaign to fund this. The more money is pledged the more tokens we can have struck – and the number of tokens produced increased exponentially with the total amount pledged. So, we are looking for groups and individuals who are able either to put money into the pot or who can distribute coins, or – ideally – both.

## About us

Besides the Everything for Everyone website, badges and patches, we have been involved in a variety of projects over the past few decades, including [The Free Association](http://www.freelyassociating.org/) writing collective (our book [Moments of Excess](https://pmpress.org.uk/product/moments-of-excess-movements-protest-and-everyday-life/) was published by PM Press in 2011) and [Turbulence: Ideas for Movement](http://www.turbulence.org.uk/).
