Money rules our lives. Whether or not we have it, how much money we carry in our pocket or in our bank account, determines our access to social wealth and our command over the time and labour of others. Without money we might end up sleeping on the street. Without money we won't eat. To obtain money – and thus access to social wealth – we must sell our ability to work, our time. We must submit to the command of others, the boss – who, in exchange, pays us a money-wage. The level of our wage – 'high' or 'low', or perhaps like the 'housewife' our work is unwaged – is a measure of how much our time is worth, of its value. Money measures the value not only of our time, but of all other commodities: not of all social wealth, but of much of it. At the same time, in the world of 'business', success is measured only by the accumulation of money, the addition of ever more zeroes in an accounting ledger: 'Accumulate! Accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets.' All that counts to the capitalist is that which can be counted in money. All other values are valueless, discounted as 'externalities'. Thus money rules in two (related) senses: first, it commands; and second, it measures.

But money's rule is not absolute. Everywhere we find cracks, interstices in which money does not command. Despite everything – after 500 years of capitalist ascendency and 40 years of neoliberal capitalism's 'financialisation' – we still care for one another, we can still act out of love, friendship, loyalty or solidarity – or perhaps out of hate, rage or resentment. Not everything is paid for!

Money and its rule are contested more directly too. The bread riots of the 18th century in which the 'English crowd' defended its '[moral economy](https://libcom.org/files/MORAL%20ECONOMY%20OF%20THE%20ENGLISH%20CROWD.pdf)'. The 'autoriducionze' (self-reduction) of rent, energy and transport prices of Italian proletarians in the period of Autonomia Operaia in the 1970s. The 'IMF riots' that occurred across Africa and Latin America in the 1980s. The looting – very often targeted against those who prey most harshly on the community – took place during riots in English cities in the mid-1980s and then in 2011. These are just four examples of common people refusing money's command.

> 'I take a few steps towards the middle of the street and study the massive, anonymous construction, and then look around in confusion. Conflicting emotions pile up within me, anger, astonishment, even irony. I stop and let it all out: "Why has no one ever talked to me about banks before?"' – Luther Blisset, _Q_

Given, money's centrality to capitalist command, capital and its state rigorously police the creation of money. The production of currency – notes and coins – is tightly controlled by central banks (the Bank of England, for instance). At the same time, the state permits 'commercial' and 'investment' banks to grant credit to their clients, in the process creating more money. (This arrangement is known as 'fractional reserve banking' since only a fraction of the money created by commercial banks – that is, only a fraction of the money in existence – is 'backed' by currency.)

Again though, capital's control is not complete. Time and time again, entrepreneurial individuals have attempted to simulate the currency of the state. In early 18th-century England, Isaac Newton, as 'Master of the Mint', had the job of hunting down 'coin-clippers', people who shaved a milimetre or two off the edge of silver coins and then melted down the shavings to produce new coins. (Newton introduced the practice of milling or 'reeding' coins, adding ridges to their edges, to make it obvious if a coin had been clipped.) Debasing the currency in this way was a capital offence: convicted coiners were hanged, drawn and quartered. Coin-clipping was also an offence against capital. The severity of the punishment is evidence not only of the state's cruelty, but also of the fragility of its rule and that of money. In certain parts of England, such as the Calder Valley on the border of Yorkshire and Lancashire, the practice of coining was both widespread and widely accepted within the community. This history is captured in Benjamin Myers's [novel](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-gallows-pole-9781526611154/) about the Cragg Vale Coiners and their leader 'King David' Hartley and is commemorated in events such as the Coiners [fell race](http://www.cvfr.co.uk/races/coiners/).

> 'I toss the coin in the air and catch it as it comes down. The writing is still clearly visible: ONE GOD, ONE FAITH, ONE BAPTISM. The relic of another defeat. A rare piece, almost unique, forged by the Münster mint.' – Luther Blisset, _Q_

Perhaps less confrontationally, commoners have over and over again created other representations of their relations of mutual dependency: tokens, chits and other types of IOU. (See David Graeber's [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://libcom.org/files/__Debt__The_First_5_000_Years.pdf).) The modern incarnation of these practices goes by the name of 'alternative' or 'complementary currencies' – the [Totnes Pound](https://www.totnespound.org/), for example. These currencies exist in a legal and political grey area. Where they have become recognised by the authorities – perhaps there is an accepted 'exchange rate' between the local currency and the state's own notes and coins; perhaps you can pay taxes in the currency – such currencies may end up complementing capitalist money and its rule, they simply become experiments in unorthodox monetary policy.

Sometimes money-like tokens might point to worlds beyond the rule of money. Rejecting both the authority of the Pope and the clericalism of Luther – and the established order that both the Roman Church and Lutherism sustained – the cry of the Anabaptist rebels of 16th-century Europe was '[Omnia sunt communia](http://www.freelyassociating.org/2013/05/omnia-sunt-communia/)' – all things in common, or Everything for Everyone! When they took over the city of Münster in 1534–35 – a short-lived and ill-fated experiment – they struck a coin that captured their faith: 'One god, one faith, one baptism'. In late 18th-century England, Thomas Spence struck numerous 'freedom coins'. [link to file] According to historian Peter Linebaugh these 'functioned as money rather than medals' and Spence used them 'as propaganda for his plan to abolish private property in land. His policy was to diffuse agitation by song, pamphlet, graffiti, newspaper and coins!'

We have struck our own freedom coin. A two-sided token, on one side is written [A COMMON TREASURY FOR ALL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCXnol8NGbg) (or these versions by [Chumbawamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEv3LpXNX8U) and [Billy Bragg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWRpl2S9iwk)) on the other, [OMNIA SUNT COMMUNIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZt_QcylurI).
