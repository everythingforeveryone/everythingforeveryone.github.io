I've taken a step back from political engagement over the last four or five years. Partly because I was struggling to work out what the fuck to do, and partly because I didn't feel at home anywhere. Actually those two reasons are inseparable. It's a **vicious circle**: without being involved in collective projects, it's impossible to get any sort of handle on what's going on. Without traction, I'm just left sat in the dark with a throbbing ultra-left gland. Cynicism as an easy option.
