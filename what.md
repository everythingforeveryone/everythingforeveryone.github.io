# (Safety) pin stuck in my heart…

![e4e badge](/assets/e4ebadges.jpg)

OK, they’re not really safety pins or even classic 1" punk badges, but these top quality hard enamel pins are the perfect way to raise the maximalist demand in your everyday life: stylishly discreet (just 15mm wide) but utterly unyielding…

They’re available from [Active Distribution](https://www.activedistributionshop.org/shop/enamel-brooches/4315-everything-for-everyone-enamel-badge.html) or [AK Press](https://www.akuk.com/everything-for-everyone-badge.html), or (in the US) from [PM Press](https://secure.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&p=948).


And if you live in the UK and want to buy a bundle (10 or more) for your friends and comrades, then drop us a line at info@ our web address and we’ll see what we can do.
