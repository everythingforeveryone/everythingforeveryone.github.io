# (Safety) pin stuck in my heart…

![e4e badge](/img/badges.jpg)

OK, they’re not really safety pins or even classic 1" punk badges, but these top quality hard enamel pins are the perfect way to raise the maximalist demand in your everyday life: stylishly discreet (just 15mm wide) but utterly unyielding…

They’re available from Active Distribution or AK Press, or (in the US) from PM Press.


And if you live in the UK and want to buy a bundle (10 or more) for your friends and comrades, then drop us a line at info@ our web address and we’ll see what we can do.

# Critical patch update…

![e4e badge](/img/patches.jpg)

We’ve just released these quality 60mm embroidered patches so now you can wear your heart on your sleeve (or on your Harrington, or on your tracksuit, or on the arse of your jeans…). Numbers are strictly limited so if you want some, drop us a line at info@ our web address and we’ll figure out a price. Like the badges they’re also available from AK Press.
